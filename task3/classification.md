# Classification of programming languages.

# Silver questions.
1.-Explain why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally
use a high-level language when writing programs?

R= Basically it depends on 2 things to define if a developer needs a high or low-level languages but generally most developers work with high-level languages when is about programs. The reason is simple, a program written
in hig-level is easier to be made, also a developer understand easily the codes to work more efficiently, the process is better so it is most common.

2.- What is a machine code?

R= A machine code is in simple words the way to comunication of a computer, is the way to convert a human actions into a understable code to do an digital action.
To have a better idea, the machine code is basically the way for a human to comunicate with a machine, a kind of language.

3.- An example of a high-level language.

R= We have a lot of types of high-level languages. Because it are in principally in english are more ways to work, some of them are java and python that are used commonly
and more known by people as other programs.

# Gold questions.
1.- Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages.

R=  The high level is easier to work because is working in english while the machine code in a low-level needs to be directly in binary so high-level is easier to be learned.
the second difference is that we can have different codes, for example: we can obtain more machine code instructions from the high-level language and in case of use low-level
we work with one specific statement.
Finally, because of work with high-level is easier we can't have the same efficieny than we work with the machine code, the why is that working with machine code is specific and direct so there is no way to have
failures as when we use high-level language where can be many interpretations.

2.- What does a translator do?

R= Basically and easy to understand, a translator is a program with the purpose  of translate the high-level language into low-level language (the machine code).
Often is used when a developer is making a program, the code lines in english are taking by the translator to have the machine code and be interpreted by a computer.

3.- Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code.

R= The interpreter that works with a line code at time and the compiler that works with all the codes at the same time.

# Platinum questions.
1.- What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?

R= As I said before the principal difference is that an interpreter works with line by line to execute each one in instance of translate it.
The compiler work with all the codes to translate it together and have a compilation of this new machine code.

2.- What is assembly language?

R= Assembly language is a type of language that works with some words that are equivalents to code and can be understood by the processor of a machine,
Basically these words are specific instructions for the machine and allows us to have a complete control of what a machine does.

3.- a) Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code.
   R= The high-level is a way to work on a program using our own language (normally english) to write fast code and stablish easily the instructions to a machine while the machine code is a low-level, the own language of machines working with a binary code, we need to translate a language into other to understand them.
   The high-level can be interpreted by too many ways while the machine code is very specific even is we use assemnly language because it need to be in the type of instruction to specific machines.

   b) i)Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code.
   
   R= The interpreter needs that the program made is saved and installed and translate code lines one by one and execute each one indediately, but the interpreter has to translate each time time the program is used so is a little bit slower than other translators.
   
   ii) State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code.
   
   R= The compiler that translate all the codes at the same time into the language needed, has de difference that need to be request to the compiler before run the program and this save a file with the codes, is slow but efficient because is the compiler finish its purpose run all those codes fast and avoid if are problems in some
   places of the lines. This is the second translator, the other one, the assemble function principally with the low-level language assembly that is more related to the machine code directly.
