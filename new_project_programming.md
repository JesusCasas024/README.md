# This is a new programming project.

Hello everybody, I'm Jesús Casas and I am a student in the programming curse of robotics 2C.

In this quarter we are learning some commands to work in command lines using apps as git-bash.
We learn about the functions, ways to use commands, ways to write them and how to work in a remote way
with classmates to do projects and activities just cloning files and modified them. It is an efficient way to work 
because we can do whatever we need without problems.
