# Summary about bash commands.
 
In the present file I am going to show some commands and explain about their functions.
To this I will show a list of commands that you can use when you work with command lines in a program 
as git-bash and the explanations about what does a command and its way to be wrote are added as a review of what I have seen in class
during the first lessons. So, basically this text function as a summary of the different commands that I saw in class to learn about programming and start 
working with the basic theory and practice different activities. 
We have commands with different purpose, it means that we have some divisions depending on the things
that you want to do. 

Let us begin with the basic commands and their respective functions. It is neccesary to mention that are some commands with 
variations, that is because some of them have a specific purpose and come for a same command, they just have some changes 
to do something related to the first purpose.

# Commands for directories.

mkdir: This is a command to create new directories/folders.
```sh 
mkdir + name
mkdir robotics
```

```sh

```

```
mv: function to change the name of a file.
```sh
mv +old name + new name with their respective extensions.
```
Less: is a command to read the content of a file.
```sh 
less +name
```

We have different commands to different needs when we are working in this kind of programs, 
each one has its main purpose and we just need to learn about what does each one and the way to write it. 
Basically, work with commands generally is just memorize the functions, how write each one and avoid forget them because 
we can make the error of use wrong the commands and then we will be confused.
We can do a lot of things with commands easily and there are a lot of guides to know how use them.
This first weeks we saw this princpal commands to start working and learn what we can do.
