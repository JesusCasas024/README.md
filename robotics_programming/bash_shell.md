# Summary about bash commands.
 
In the present markdown I am going to show some commands and explain about their functions.
To this I will show a list of commands that you can use when you work with command lines in a program 
as git-bash and the explanations are added as a review of what I have seen in class. So, basically this
text function as a summary of the different commands saw in class to learn about programming and start 
with the basic theory and practice. 
We have commands with different purpose, it means that we have some divisions depending on the things
that you want to do. 

Let us begin with the commands and their respective functions. It is neccesary to mention that are some commands with 
variations, that is because some of them have a specific purpose.

We have different commands to different actions where we are working in this programs, 
each one has its purpose and we just need to learn about what does each one. 
basically work with commands in general is just memorize the functions and avoid forget them.
Using commands we can do a lot of things easily and there are a lot of guides to know how use them.
This first weeks we saw this princpal commands to start working and learn what we can do.
