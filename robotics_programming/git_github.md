# Summary about git commands and github.

In this file I am going to show some commands of git and to be in context about the functionment of github
I will start with some information to know more about what we can do in its platform. 
All we know that are a lot of different commands, starting with the common as the commands to create files but in this case I am going to talk about the specific commands used to git. 
We have the connection between the commands used in the line commands of git as git bash and the platform github where we can upload commits from git in a remote way.
In github we can hosting code, version control and collaborate with other people to work on projects, modifying files and creating roots to avoid problems with the original project.
Github has the possibility of work in local form and then sumbit the projects or anything you do to the platform where you team mates can clone the files and change it, so it is a platform very good to work.

# The git commands.

There we have a list of the git commmands used during this weeks of work:

Git init: Used to start a new project or directory.
```sh
git init
```

Git clone: Used to clone a repository generally to a remote server.
```sh
git clone nombredeusuario@host:/path/to/repository
```

Git add: To add files in our preparation area.
```sh
git add + file .(format)
```

Git commit: take a screenshot to the changes did and will save it in the directory.
```sh
git commit -m "message that goes with the commit"
```

Git config: stablish a user configuration as email, username and type of format.
```sh 
git config --global user.email + the email.
```

Git status: Show the files that were changed and the files ready to be changed or confirmed.
```sh
git status
```
Git push: send local confirmations to the main root in the repository.
```sh
git push origin master
```
Git checkout: create roots to work on a file without changed the original file.
```sh
git checkout -b branch + name.
```
 
Git remote: allow you to see the remote repositories.
